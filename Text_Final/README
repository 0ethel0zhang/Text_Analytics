Explain what the code does and how to run it:

What the code does?
The goal of this code is to apply sentiment analysis for movie reviews. There are several different sentiment analyzers (5 models using basic word processing + 5 models using lemmatization + 1 model using pos/neg ratio)that automatically classifies input data as either positive or negative. The analyzer is trained on training data using supervised machine learning.

How to run the code?
1. Download the jupyter notebook, and the data scource ('NRC_Emotion.txt', 'review_polarity.tar.gz') into one directory.
2. Run all cells in the jupyter notebook.
3. Results will be output into a answers.txt file under the same directory.
