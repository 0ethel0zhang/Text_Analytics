1) Design Decisions:
The task at hand (example cases in the assignment description and sample article) exhibits five distinct patterns of date-related entities.

The five patterns are:
1. "Month Day, Year" structure with optional time like "January 15, 2014 8am"
2. "Day Month" structure variation like "the 21st of December"
3. "Month/Day/Year" structure variations like "01/15/2014"
4. Day of the week with optional time such as "Monday', 'Monday the 23rd', 'Monday, 2pm', and 'Monday afternoon'.
5. Holidays like 'Christmas Day'

Each pattern is thus singled out to compile to take into account its own variations.

When the file is being processed, each sentence is processed sequentially by each of the five patterns to avoid potential double-counting.

2) Performance calculation:
A. input1
confusion matrix
1. Exact Match
,true positive (TP), true negative(TN), false positive(FP), false negative(FN)
absolute value,11,412,0,0
percentages,100%, 100%, 0%, 0%

precision = (TP)/(TP+FP) = 11/(11+0) = 1
recall = (TP)/(TP+FN) = 11/(11+0) = 1
F-score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) = 2*1*1/(1+1) = 1

2. Partial Match
true positive (TP), true negative(TN), false positive(FP), false negative(FN)
absolute value,11,412,0,0
percentages,100%, 100%, 0%, 0%

precision = (TP)/(TP+FP) = 11/(11+0) = 1
recall = (TP)/(TP+FN) = 11/(11+0) = 1
F-score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) = 2*1*1/(1+1) = 1

B. input2
confusion matrix
1. Exact Match
,true positive (TP), true negative(TN), false positive(FP), false negative(FN)
absolute value,10,493,0,0
percentages,100%, 100%, 0%, 0%

precision = (TP)/(TP+FP) = 10/(10+0) = 1
recall = (TP)/(TP+FN) = 10/(10+0) = 1
F-score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) = 2*1*1/(1+1) = 1

2. Partial Match
,true positive (TP), true negative(TN), false positive(FP), false negative(FN)
absolute value,10,493,0,0
percentages,100%, 100%, 0%, 0%

precision = (TP)/(TP+FP) = 10/(10+0) = 1
recall = (TP)/(TP+FN) = 10/(10+0) = 1
F-score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) = 2*1*1/(1+1) = 1

3) Analyze the result:
Based on the select training and test data, the system is able to perform at 100% accuracy.
All matched are exact match instead of partical matches, since the design decision was made to cover as many variations as possible.
However, further evaluation can be done on outside sources to improve the design, where some other cases may not have been considered.
